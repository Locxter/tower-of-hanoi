## Overview

This is a visualization of the classic game Tower of Hanoi using an iterative algorithm to calculate the fastest way of solving it.

## Dependencies

I generally try to minimize dependencies, but I'm a one man crew and can therefore only support Debian as I'm running it myself. Anyway, you need to have the following packages installed for everything to work properly:

- VSCodium as universal text editor and IDE. To install it visit their [website](https://vscodium.com/#install).
- VSCodium extensions Live Preview and Sort lines to enhance it's capabilities. Install them with `codium --install-extension ms-vscode.live-server --install-extension Tyriar.sort-lines`.
- Firefox for viewing the website. Install it with `sudo apt install firefox-esr`.
