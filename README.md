## Overview

This is a visualization of the classic game Tower of Hanoi using an iterative algorithm to calculate the fastest way of solving it.

## Dependencies

I generally try to minimize dependencies, but I'm a one man crew and can therefore only support Ubuntu as I'm running it myself. Anyway, you need to have the following packages installed for everything to work properly:

- VSCodium as universal text editor and IDE. Install it with `sudo snap install codium --classic`.
- Firefox for viewing the website. Install it with `sudo snap install firefox`.
